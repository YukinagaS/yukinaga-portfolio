## The Logic of Letter Coloring
In this log, I want to talk about the process of implementing the logic for coloring letters after they were guessed.

### 在庫確認方式
I want to include discussion of my initial approach with the Yes/No flow chart, and continue with the actual execution, with a code block. In fact, I'll test a code block next.

```App.jsx
  function checkGuess() {
    // Count the instances of each letter in the answer
    const answerLetterCount = {}
    answer.forEach((letter) => answerLetterCount[letter] = answer.filter(moji => moji === letter).length)
    // Subtract correct(green) guesses to account for remaining yellows.
    const remainingPresent = answerLetterCount;
    currentGuess.forEach((letter, i) => {
      (answer[i] === letter) && remainingPresent[letter]--;
    })

    return currentGuess.map((letter, i) => {
      if(answer[i] === letter) { // If correct, green. Always.
        return {letter: letter, color: "bg-correct"};
      } else  if (remainingPresent[letter] > 0) { // Check if remaining yellows can apply.
        remainingPresent[letter]--;
        return {letter: letter, color: "bg-present"};
      } else {
        return {letter: letter, color: "bg-absent"};
      }
    });
  };
```

Let's see if this works.
